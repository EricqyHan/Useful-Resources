# Git Lessons

### Note that Git is a version control system 

#### Git Basics
The *git clone* and *git init* commands are used to set up new repositories.

The *git add*, *git status*, and *git commit* commands are the most frequently used subcommands in all of Git. They're used when committing new versions of files.

The *git log* command is also important; it lets you view a list of your old commits.

The *git mv* and *git rm* commands move and remove files that are being tracked by Git. 

The *git push* and *git pull* commands are used to synchronize commits with Git repositories on other computers.
